This is an animated graph made in matplotlib showing the price of an Apple
share from 1986 to the present day.

This was my first time using matplotlib and pandas but I didn't do anything too fancy besides the animation thing so it wasn't too difficult to implement. Unfrotunately the ticks on the y-axis could not update for some reason which I spent a long time trying to debug but was ultimately unsuccessful.

My first impressions of panda is that it is a really nice and easy way to store and extract data. Filtering data is so much easier compared to sql. Pandas does require extra memory to load the entire dataset which is a con compared to SQL but for basic operations like this the difference is negligeble. Matplotlib was about what I expected although the animation sub library was a little unintuitive at first.

Overall I am happy I learnt the very basics of pandas and matplotlib as it will allow me to explore data science and machine learning in more depth in the future.
